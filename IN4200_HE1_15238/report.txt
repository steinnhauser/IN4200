Count_mutual_links1:

To do this, first loop through all the pages that 4 is linked to. For each
of these, count how many other nodes are also linked to this one. Doing this using the 2D matrix involves moving to column 4, starting from the
top and moving on down, and each time a 1 is encountered ('ToID links'), you
count how many other 1's are in that row ('FromID links' to the node).

j indicates the column. Move from left to right and top to bottom
Check if any of these values equal 1.
If so, we want to count up 1's in that row.
